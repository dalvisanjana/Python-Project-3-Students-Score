# Python-Project-3-Students-Score


Student Score Data Analysis Project
Overview
This project focuses on analyzing a dataset from Kaggle containing information about student scores. The dataset includes various factors such as student demographics, study time, and exam scores. The goal of the analysis is to extract meaningful insights that can inform educational strategies and contribute to understanding the factors influencing student performance.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project can be found on Kaggle: www.kaggle.comt

Features
Gender: Student's gender.
Race/Ethnicity: Student's race/ethnicity.
Parental Level of Education: Highest level of education attained by the student's parents.
Lunch: Type of lunch the student receives.
Test Preparation Course: Whether the student completed a test preparation course.
Math Score: Score achieved in the math exam.
Reading Score: Score achieved in the reading exam.
Writing Score: Score achieved in the writing exam.
Tools and Technologies Used
Python: The entire analysis is done using Python programming language.
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn for data manipulation and visualization.
Jupyter Notebooks: The analysis is presented in Jupyter notebooks to provide an interactive and reproducible environment.
Analysis Steps
Data Cleaning: Handled missing values, outliers, and ensured data consistency.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Explored the dataset to understand distributions, correlations, and patterns.
Visualizations: Used various charts and graphs to visualize relationships and trends in the data.
Statistical Analysis: Conducted statistical tests to validate hypotheses and assumptions.
Insights and Recommendations: Summarized findings and provided actionable insights for educational stakeholders.

Results
The results of the analysis are summarized in the Jupyter notebooks. Key findings include the impact of various factors on student scores, the effectiveness of test preparation courses, and patterns in performance based on demographic information.

Future Work
Future enhancements to this project could include predictive modeling to forecast student scores based on the identified factors, and the development of interactive dashboards for more accessible insights.
